                <p>All praise is to Allah Rabbul A’lamin, who created us as “Ashraful Makhlukat”. The reason for our superiority has been given by Allah in the Holy Quran. “You are the best of nations, your duty is to call people to goodness, to enjoin good deeds and to forbid evil deeds.” So this is the only reason for our superiority, which does not apply to any other creation. In this short life cycle of my life, I chose the profession of “teaching” because of the extreme urge of life-questioning. Because there is no other option to create “Ashraful Makhlukat” without teaching platform.</p>

                <p>There is no alternative to education for the development of the nation. A nation can rise to the pinnacle of development through education. The nation must be educated to develop its own civilization and culture. However, one cannot help but be dismayed by the horrors of the current degradation of social and human values. It is becoming more and more clear day by day that education devoid of religious and moral values is incapable of developing the true human qualities of man. Therefore, nation-building with religious and moral values is the need of the hour.</p>

                <p>This sacred responsibility of nation-building mainly rests on the educational institutions of the country. Inspired by this belief and understanding, we have been trying to reflect the ideals of religious and moral values in the students’ thinking, following and serving since the inception of our school.</p>
